= Take control of the WordPress dashboard =

With Client Dash, WordPress webmasters have full control of the WP-Admin area. With an end goal of helping improve the User Experience within WordPress specifically for clients, we've created and implemented numerous powerful features for simplifying and customizing the dashboard.

Here are some of the major features:

= Customize the Admin Menu =

As of version 1.6, you are now able to completely customize the WordPress admin menu using the built in, drag and drop menu system you are already familiar with. This will enable you to:

* Reorder all menu items
* Rearrange menu items
* Remove menu items
* Customize menu items (label, link, icon, etc.)
* Add new menu items

Customizing the admin menu previously was very complicated and no elegant, intuitive solutions existed. With Client Dash, it is now so easy that anyone familiar with the existing WordPress menu system can do it.

Admin menus are also controlled on a per role basis so you are able to completely control the admin menu for each individual role.

= Dashboard Widget Manager =

Have you ever wished you could customize the WordPress dashboard a little more? Well if you are capable of using the built in WordPress widget manager than with Client Dash you've found your solution.

We implemented a powerful dashboard widget control feature which works exactly the same as the WordPress widget manager you're already familiar with. So now, adding, removing, rearranging and customizing WP dashboard widgets is easier than ever before.

= Extremely Extensible =

From the start, Client Dash has been created with developers in mind. We've worked very hard to make extending Client Dash as easy as possible. To that end, we've created an Extension Boilerplate which does almost all of the work for you...and that is only the beginning!

If you are a developer and want to learn more about extending Client Dash, please subscribe to our [mailing list](http://realbigplugins.com/subscribe/?utm_source=Client%20Dash&utm_medium=Readme%20link&utm_campaign=Client%20Dash%20Plugin). We'll be sharing our documentation, tips, features and beta releases that way.

= What else does Client Dash do? =

Upon activation, Client Dash modifies the `wp-admin` in the following ways:

* Removes all default dashboard widgets
* Creates several new admin pages and adds their links under Dashboard in the admin menu
* Creates new dashboard widgets with large buttons that direct users to these new pages
* Adds tabs with helpful information on each of these new pages
* Removes the WordPress logo and menu from the toolbar
* (Multisite) Removes the My Sites menu from the toolbar and the admin menu
* (Multisite) Moves the My Sites information to a tab on the Account page

Also included under Client Dash settings are:

* Controls for restricting access to content on Client Dash pages for specific roles
* An intuitive icon selector for changing the dashicons used for Client Dash pages and dashboard widgets
* An option to reset all Client Dash settings to their defaults
* A directory of existing add-ons for Client Dash

We are also extremely receptive to suggestions, feature requests and collaborations so if you have anything to add or that you would like to see included in Client Dash, please visit the support forum here and engage us. Also, stay tuned as we are working on lots of new updates to this plugin and are also actively developing some exciting add-ons. Lots more to come!

== Installation ==

Using this plugin is very simple. All you have to do is:

1. Upload the `client-dash` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

3. Configure settings by going to Settings - >Client Dash

== Screenshots ==

1. The new wp-admin dashboard. This is your new landing page. You can customize visibility of each item based on the role.

2. The display customization page for the core Client Dash pages and their content. You can customize who sees what with ease (including custom roles)!

3. Client Dash offers the ability to completely take control of the default WordPress Administration Menu (on the left of the admin screen). It's the menu system that we all have come to know and love.

4. You can customize the default icons used in Client Dash with this beautiful icon selector (supports all WordPress standard Dashicons).

5. Webmasters have the ability to add a custom section that can be customized to fit any companies needs.

6. Take control over the dashboard with the new dashboard widget customizer! It uses the WordPress Widget API, so you'll feel right at home.

7. Client Dash has a few addons available, and many more to come!
