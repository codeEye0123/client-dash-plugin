<h3>Webmasters rejoice!</h3>

At long last, a vastly improved interface for clients has arrived. Client Dash seeks to provide a simplified and intuitive admin user experience for customers who login to WordPress sites which were developed and are managed by an agency/webmaster.

<h4>What does Client Dash do?</h4>

Upon activation, Client Dash modifies the wp-admin in the following ways:

* Removes all default dashboard widgets
* Creates several new admin pages and adds their links under Dashboard in the admin menu
* Creates new dashboard widgets with large buttons that direct users to these new pages
* Adds tabs with helpful information on each of these new pages
* Removes the WordPress logo and menu from the toolbar
* (Multisite) Removes the My Sites menu from the toolbar and the admin menu
* (Multisite) Moves the My Sites information to a tab on the Account page


== Installation ==

1. Upload the `client-dash` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
