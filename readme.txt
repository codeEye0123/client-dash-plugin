== Description ==

= Webmasters rejoice! =

At long last, a vastly improved interface for clients has arrived. Client Dash seeks to provide a simplified and intuitive admin user experience for customers who login to WordPress sites which were developed and are managed by an agency/webmaster.

= What does Client Dash do? =

Upon activation, Client Dash modifies the wp-admin in the following ways:

* Removes all default dashboard widgets
* Provides options for selectively adding back dashboard widgets
* Creates several new admin pages and adds their links under Dashboard in the admin menu
* Creates new dashboard widgets with large buttons that direct users to these new pages
* Adds tabs with helpful information on each of these new pages
* Removes the WordPress logo and menu from the toolbar
* (Multisite) Removes the My Sites menu from the toolbar and the admin menu
* (Multisite) Moves the My Sites information to a tab on the Account page

There is a lot more to come from this plugin in the future. Client Dash has been designed from day 1 to be as flexible as possible so if you are a developer you will absolutely love it. In the near future we will be publishing detailed documentation on how this plugin can be modified and extended. We will also be releasing numerous extensions of our own which will integrate with a variety of useful external tools to help you provide even more value to your customers.

We are also extremely receptive to suggestions, feature requests and collaborations so if you have anything to add or that you would like to see included in Client Dash, please visit the support forum here and engage us. Also, stay tuned as we are working on lots of new updates to this plugin and are also actively developing some exciting add-ons.
