= Take control of the WordPress Admin =

With Client Dash, WordPress administrators have full control of the WordPresss admin. With an end goal of helping improve the user experience within WordPress specifically for clients, we've created and implemented numerous powerful features for simplifying and customizing the dashboard.

= Client Dash Customize Admin Tool =

Client Dash offers a powerful tool for you to take complete control of the WordPress admin for you and your users. The Customize Admin Tool gives you a, never before seen, live preview of your admin area as you customize it. Customizations are easy, intuitive, and simple to make. You can give each user role a unique view of the admin area.

This tool allows you to customize the following:

= Customize the Admin Menu =

You are able to completely customize the WordPress admin menu using the powerful Client Dash Customize Admin tool. You are able to:

* Customize menu items
* Reorder all menu items
* Remove menu items
* Add new menu items

Admin menus are also controlled on a per role basis so you are able to completely control the admin menu for each individual role.

= Customize the Dashboard Widgets =

Have you ever wished you could customize the WordPress dashboard a little more? Well with Client Dash you've found your solution.

We implemented a powerful dashboard widget control feature using the powerful Client Dash Customize Admin tool. So now, adding, removing, rearranging and customizing WP dashboard widgets is easier than ever before.

= Customizable Admin Page =

Client Dash offers you a fully customizable Admin Page. You customize the following:

* Which roles can see the page.
* The page icon.
* The page content, using the same editor you use for regular pages.
* The page title.

You can put anything you like in this page. You could use this page as a landing page for clients, an instructions page, etc.

Want to have an unlimitted number of customizable Admin Pages? Try out [Client Dash Pro](https://realbigplugins.com/plugins/client-dash-pro) to unlock this feature!

= Helper Pages =

Client Dash includes a few helpful pages for your users and clients. These pages include some basic, helpful information. Each of these helper pages can be renamed, re-positioned, and visible to roles that you specify.

= Extremely Extensible =

From the start, Client Dash has been created with developers in mind. We've worked very hard to make extending Client Dash as easy as possible.

We are also extremely receptive to suggestions, feature requests and collaborations so if you have anything to add or that you would like to see included in Client Dash, please visit the support forum here and engage us. Also, stay tuned as we are working on lots of new updates to this plugin and are also actively developing some exciting add-ons. Lots more to come!
