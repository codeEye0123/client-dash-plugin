# Client Dash 2.0

This is the branch for the first major revision release of Client Dash: 2.0

2.0 is a complete overhaul of the plugin infrastructure, both under the hood and user interfaces. The biggest feature of the 2.0 release is the introduction of the new "Admin Customizer".

## BEFORE YOU TEST THIS PLUGIN

Note that this plugin is not yet release-ready. It is considered **unstable** until final release. If you test this plugin on your website, you must understand it is considered a risk and *could break your website*. Please only install this on development websites, and not live, production websites.

Also note, 2.0 does not yet migrate your current Client Dash content (menus, widgets, settings, etc). It is not advised to install this plugin on a website already running, or has already ran Client Dash. Please test this on a clean install. Before the official 2.0 release, we will be adding the migration/transition methods into 2.0, so that you can properly migrate from the current version of Client Dash to this new, 2.0 version.

All of that said, we would not open this up to the public if we didn't believe it was relatively stable. We encourage you to help us test this plugin and get it ready for official release.

Please continue reading this README, as it has helpful information for testing.

Please add all feedback to issues in this GitHub repository. Add a new issue here: https://github.com/realbigplugins/client-dash/issues/new. Please make it explicitely clear that the issue is with 2.0 and not the current version of Client Dash.

## Features to test

### Admin Customizer

The most notable feature of 2.0 is the introduction of the "Admin Customizer". Most of the focus should be put here for testing. This is accessed by clicking on "Client Dash" in the admin menu, or by hovering over "Client Dash" and then clicking "Customize Admin".

### Admin Page

Client Dash has a feature called "Webmaster". This is where you can customize a custom admin page. This has been re-named to "Admin Page". You can access this in "Client Dash" -> "Admin Page".
